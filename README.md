# Buckypaper Application
The code calculates the necessary diameter for cables on the Mackinac Bridge, assuming they were made from buckypaper while maintaining the same safety factor as the existing cables.

## This code was developed as part of a class project for ME 5730 (Materials Selection).
I wanted to learn Fortran, so I wrote the same code in three different programming languages to compare and verify the results.
